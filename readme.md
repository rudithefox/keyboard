# Keyboards

Some thoughts, notes & resources on keyboards.  
  
There are some reasons why thinking about the keyboard you use could be useful.  
## Why?

Our bodies don't seem to like the way we sit and work using a 'traditional' keyboard. Short term there are things like hand, shoulder and back pain. Long term there are considerations like [Ulnar Deviation](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325777). Not to mention the fact that the staggered key rows and key positions were solutions to problems that the modern keyboard (opposed to the typewriter) doesn't have anymore.

Using a keyboard that is Split and Ortholinear (the keys are directly above one another) fixes some of these issues. Doing things like tenting your split keyboard (picthing it up on the inside so that your hands don't need to be parralel to the table), using a more economical key layout like Dvorak can do even more, but its easy to get lost so try start at a point and explore.  
### My experience

For me personally its a mix. I often sit with my legs up and knees tucked in to my chest. I wanted to use a split keyboard to make that more comfortable. A good friend had bought an Atreusz & promptly cut it in half, connecting the sides with ethernet cables. He was kind enough to give it to me. The blank keycaps, new layout (still QWERTY, at least) & split took some getting used it. 

In addition to being more comfortable the ortholinear layout & multiple key layers turned out to be welcomed guests. The good ol' Atreus, dismemebered and recreated, taught me many things and is the reason I will likely never go back to a 'traditional' setup. Two of its switches no longer work, unfortuntely.

## Current Setup

Using a Minidox with Yellow Ink V2 switches & some double shot PBT caps. I had initially made one with red Gateron switches. They were fine, but a bit too light for me. The Inks are more satisfying.

### Notes

The Minidox has 36 keys, 6 less than the Atreus. To deal with the reduced number a lot of the keymaps have a press key & a hold key assigned for each function key. Maybe this is fine for most, but I found that I had a lazy 'space' press, which would turn into CTRL. This would go from wanting to press space and a 'W' to closing my browser tab, so my keymap doesn't use the seperate press & hold presses for 'space'.
